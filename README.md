ðŸ“š Music Recommender Engine


This is a machine learning-based recommender system that suggests relevant items based on user interactions. The model has been trained on a large dataset and uses pickle files for inference.

The Dataset used in this project is from kaggle[kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset)

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Preprocessed data is fed into a recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based).
- Trained models are serialized using `pickle` and used during inference.
- Large model files are **not stored in this GitHub repository** but are fetched dynamically at runtime from external storage.

## ðŸ§  Model Files

Due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit, the trained model files are hosted externally.

- `cosine_sim.pkl` (700MB)
- `new_df.pkl` (69.7MB)
